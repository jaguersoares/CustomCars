# Custom Cars
A small car racing game where the user can photograph real cars and use the images as a Skin in the race;

This game was initially developed to practice unity3d and so my son could photograph his toy cars and use them in the game.
It has only been tested on Android.

It has 4 cars that can be used, one of them non-tex Skin, through the editor, users will be able to photograph toy cars from two different angles and use the skin during the game.

I initially made 3 levels, the game was not well tested but the features are there.
feel free to download and test this little game.
